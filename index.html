When comparing my index.html page to atpworldtour.com, I noticted the html tag meta being used frequently. This meta tag provides metadata (data about data) about different elements in the HTML file. One big difference between atpworldtour.com and my index.html page is on atpworldtour.com, there are a lot of scripts being run and several links to different social media accounts. On index.html, I only have information on one page with another html file that is linked to index.html. atpworldtour.com is a website that is much larger and contains JavaScript frameworks such as bootstrap which creates a website into panels so it is easier to view on a platform such as a mobile device. atpworldtour.com also contains css source code to be able to create a website that is much more appealing and colorful for a user.
